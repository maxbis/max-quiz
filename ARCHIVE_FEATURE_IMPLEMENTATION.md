# Quiz Archive Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a quiz archiving system that allows you to hide old quizzes from the main list without permanently deleting them. This keeps your quiz list manageable while preserving historical data.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Changes
- **New Column**: Added `archived` column to the `quiz` table
  - Type: TINYINT(1) 
  - Default: 0 (not archived)
  - Values: 0 = active, 1 = archived
  - Added index for better query performance

### 2. Model Updates
**Quiz Model** (`models/Quiz.php`)
- Added `archived` property
- Updated validation rules to include archived field
- Set default value to 0
- Added attribute label

### 3. Controller Updates
**QuizController** (`controllers/QuizController.php`)

#### Modified `actionIndex()`
- Added `$show` parameter with 3 options:
  - `'active'` (default) - Shows only non-archived quizzes
  - `'archived'` - Shows only archived quizzes
  - `'all'` - Shows all quizzes regardless of archive status
- Passes `$showFilter` to the view

#### New `actionToggleArchive($id)`
- Toggles the archive status of a quiz
- When archiving: automatically deactivates the quiz
- Shows success/error flash messages
- Redirects back to quiz list

### 4. View Updates
**Quiz List View** (`views/quiz/index2.php`)

#### Filter Buttons
Added filter buttons at the top:
- **Active Quizzes** - Shows only active (non-archived) quizzes (default)
- **Archived Quizzes** - Shows only archived quizzes
- **All Quizzes** - Shows everything

#### Visual Indicators
- **Archived Badge**: Shows "ARCHIVED" badge next to archived quiz names
- **Faded Appearance**: Archived quizzes appear with reduced opacity (60%)
- **Disabled Checkbox**: Active checkbox is disabled for archived quizzes
- **Hover Effect**: Slightly increases opacity on hover for better readability

#### Actions Menu
Added to the "More" dropdown:
- **ðŸ“¦ Archive** button (for active quizzes) - Archives the quiz

- Confirmation dialog before archiving/restoring

## Database Migration

**IMPORTANT**: You need to run the SQL migration to add the `archived` column to your database.

### Option 1: Using phpMyAdmin

3. Go to the SQL tab
4. Copy and paste the contents of `migrations/add_archived_to_quiz.sql`
5. Click "Go" to execute

### Option 2: Using MySQL Command Line
```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd d:\www\yii2\max-quiz

# Run the migration (adjust path to mysql.exe if needed)
mysql -u root -p max-quiz < migrations/add_archived_to_quiz.sql
```

### Option 3: Using Docker (if applicable)
```bash
docker exec -i max-quiz-db mysql -u root -p max-quiz < migrations/add_archived_to_quiz.sql
```
