# AI Answer Generation - Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

Added AI-powered answer generation to the question creation form. When creating a new question, users can now enter a question and automatically generate 6 answers (1 correct, 5 incorrect) using LM Studio's local AI API.

## Files Modified

### 1. `controllers/QuestionController.php`
**Added:** New action method `actionGenerateAnswers()`

**Location:** Lines 873-960

**What it does:**
- Receives the question text via POST request
- Connects to LM Studio API on `http://localhost:1234/v1/chat/completions`
- Sends a prompt asking AI to generate 6 answers in JSON format
- Parses the AI response and extracts answers
- Returns JSON with success status and the 6 answers
- Handles errors gracefully (connection errors, invalid responses, etc.)

**Key features:**
- Uses OpenAI-compatible API format (works with LM Studio)
- Removes markdown code blocks from AI response if present
- Validates that exactly 6 answers are returned
- First answer is always marked as correct
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

### 2. `views/question/_form.php`
**Changes:**
1. Added import for `yii\helpers\Url` (line 4)
2. Added AI generation button in Question section (lines 354-367)
3. Added JavaScript function for AI integration (lines 673-747)

**What was added:**

#### A. UI Button (only shown when creating new questions)
```php
<?php if ($model->isNewRecord): ?>
    <button type="button" id="ai-generate-btn" class="btn btn-info">
        ðŸ¤– Generate Answers with AI
    </button>
<?php endif; ?>
```

- Only appears on new question creation (not when editing)
- Full-width button with loading state animation
- Help text explaining the feature

#### B. JavaScript Function `generateAnswersWithAI()`
**Functionality:**
1. Validates that a question is entered
2. Shows loading spinner during generation
3. Makes AJAX POST request to `/question/generate-answers`
4. Receives 6 answers from AI
5. Auto-fills all 6 answer textareas (a1-a6)
6. Sets correct answer field to "1"
7. Updates character counts for each answer
8. Highlights first answer as correct (green styling)
9. Shows success/error messages
10. Handles connection errors gracefully

## How to Use

### Prerequisites
1. Install LM Studio from https://lmstudio.ai/
2. Download a language model (e.g., Mistral, Llama 2)
3. Start LM Studio's local server on port 1234

### Steps
1. Go to **Question** â†’ **Create Question**
2. Enter your question in the question field
3. Click **"ðŸ¤– Generate Answers with AI"**
4. Wait 5-15 seconds for AI to generate answers
5. Review the generated answers
6. Edit if needed
7. Save the question

## Technical Details

### API Communication Flow
```
User clicks button
    â†“
JavaScript validates question text exists
    â†“
AJAX POST to /question/generate-answers
    â†“
QuestionController receives request
    â†“
Connects to LM Studio at localhost:1234
    â†“
Sends prompt with question
    â†“
AI generates 6 answers in JSON format
    â†“
Controller parses and validates response
    â†“
Returns JSON to frontend
    â†“
JavaScript fills in form fields
    â†“
User reviews and saves
```

### LM Studio API Request Format
```json
{
  "model": "local-model",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "You are a quiz question assistant..."
    },
    {
      "role": "user", 
      "content": "Given the following question, generate exactly 6 answers..."
    }
  ],
  "max_tokens": 500,
  "temperature": 0.7
}
```

### Expected AI Response
```json
{
  "answers": [
    "Correct answer here",
    "Incorrect answer 1",
    "Incorrect answer 2", 
    "Incorrect answer 3",
    "Incorrect answer 4",
    "Incorrect answer 5"
  ]
}
```

## Features & UX Improvements

1. **Loading State**: Button shows spinner and "Generating answers..." text during API call
2. **Error Handling**: Clear error messages if AI is unavailable or returns invalid data
3. **Auto-highlighting**: First answer automatically highlighted in green as correct
4. **Character Counts**: All answer fields update their character counts after AI fill
5. **Non-blocking**: User can still edit question or navigate away during generation
6. **Visual Feedback**: Success alert confirms when answers are generated
7. **Smart Validation**: 
   - Checks if question exists before API call
   - Validates AI response has exactly 6 answers
   - Handles JSON parsing errors

## Error Messages

| Error | Meaning | Solution |
|-------|---------|----------|
| "Please enter a question first" | Question field is empty | Enter a question before clicking button |
| "Error connecting to AI service" | Can't reach LM Studio | Start LM Studio and ensure server is running on port 1234 |
| "AI did not return 6 answers" | Invalid AI response format | Try rephrasing question or check AI model |
| "AI service error: 503" | LM Studio server error | Restart LM Studio or check model is loaded |

## Configuration

### Changing LM Studio Port
If you need to use a different port, modify line 892 in `QuestionController.php`:
```php
$client = new Client([
    'baseUrl' => 'http://localhost:YOUR_PORT_HERE',
]);
```

### Adjusting AI Parameters
In `actionGenerateAnswers()`, you can modify:
- `max_tokens`: Increase for longer answers (line 916)
- `temperature`: 0.1-1.0 for creativity level (line 917)
- `model`: Change model name if needed (line 905)

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Button only appears on create page, not edit page
- [x] Validation prevents empty questions
- [x] Loading state shows while waiting for AI
- [x] Answers populate all 6 fields correctly
- [x] Correct answer field set to 1
- [x] First answer highlighted in green
- [x] Character counts update
- [x] Error handling works when LM Studio is offline
- [x] Success message displays
- [x] Button re-enables after completion

## Future Enhancement Ideas

1. Allow user to specify which answer should be correct (not always #1)
2. Generate multiple question variations at once
3. Add "Regenerate" button to try again
4. Save AI generation history
5. Support for different AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
6. Configurable number of answers (not always 6)
7. AI model selection dropdown
8. Temperature/creativity slider
9. Preview mode before accepting answers
10. Undo/Redo for AI generations

## Dependencies

- **PHP**: `yii\httpclient\Client` for HTTP requests

- **Bootstrap**: For button styling and spinner animation

## Browser Compatibility

Tested and working on:
- Chrome/Edge (Chromium-based)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Opera

Requires:
- Modern browser with Fetch API support
